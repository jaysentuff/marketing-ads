    "llm_reasoning": "**TEST**: Creative/Audience Refresh for TOF Testing**\n- What: Launch new ad sets within TOF Testing campaign with fresh creative angles\n- Why: Campaign has high spend ($337/day) but declining session quality and efficiency - may have creative fatigue\n- Confidence: Medium\n- Signals considered: High spend concentration, lower session quality, stable but underwhelming performance\n- Risk: Additional testing spend without guaranteed improvement\n- Monitor: Compare new ad sets' session quality and conversion metrics vs. existing sets\n\n### Learning from Past Decisions\nThis is your first recorded analysis, but I note you recently increased Meta budgets by $75/day. The data suggests this scaling hasn't yet improved TOF efficiency, indicating a need for optimization before further expansion.\n\n### Questions/Uncertainties\n\u2022 **Creative fatigue timeline**: How long has the current TOF creative been running? This would inform refresh urgency\n\u2022 **Audience overlap**: Are the two TOF campaigns targeting similar audiences, potentially cannibalizing each other?\n\u2022 **Attribution window**: The 14-day lag in Meta-to-branded search correlation suggests we should wait 2+ weeks to see the full impact of recent budget increases\n\nThe TOF ecosystem is functioning (driving awareness) but needs efficiency optimization before scaling further.\n",
